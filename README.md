# Gris save editor

This is the repository for the Gris savegame editor over at https://gris-editor.zainlessbrombie.com.  
To be honest, I just wanted to unstuck the "Block Friend" NPC and things got a little out of hand.

## About the code

The code is not legible.  
Maybe I'll go back and clean it up at some point but for now "it works".
